    question: "What are the eligibility criteria for BCA and BBA?",
    answer: "Both BCA and BBA require 12th pass (any stream) with a minimum of 50% marks. There's no entrance exam — just a counselling session to ensure the program is the right fit for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a Degree program and a Skill Course?",
    answer: "Degree programs (BCA & BBA) are 3-year university-affiliated programs that give you an accredited bachelor's degree plus on-job training. Skill Courses (Full-Stack Dev & Digital Marketing) are shorter, intensive programs (3–6 months) focused on immediate job readiness with industry certificates. Both include placement support.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is placement actually guaranteed?",
    answer: "We have a 95% placement rate — which means we actively work to place every eligible student. We don't guarantee a specific salary, but we do guarantee dedicated placement support: resume building, mock interviews, referrals, and direct connections with 180+ hiring partners.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are the programs available online?",
    answer: "BCA and BBA are primarily offline (Agra campus), as they are university degree programs requiring physical attendance. Full-Stack Dev and Digital Marketing are available in hybrid mode (offline classes + recorded access online).",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the fee and EMI options?",
    answer: "Skill courses start from ₹15,000 (Digital Marketing) and ₹25,000 (Full-Stack Dev). Degree program fees are shared during your counselling session. EMI and instalment options are available across all programs — contact us to know the exact payment plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I miss classes?",
    answer: "All sessions are recorded and shared with enrolled students. Our mentors also hold weekly doubt-clearing sessions. For degree programs, we follow the university attendance policy (minimum 75% physical attendance required).",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch programs after joining?",
    answer: "Program switches are evaluated case-by-case within the first 2 weeks of joining. After that, seat allocation and scheduling make switches difficult. We strongly recommend attending a counselling session before enrolling to make the right choice from the start.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need prior coding experience for Full-Stack Development?",
    answer: "No. Our Full-Stack bootcamp is designed for beginners. The first month covers fundamentals from scratch. However, a basic comfort with computers (using a browser, typing) is assumed.",
  },
